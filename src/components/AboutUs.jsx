        ðŸŒ¸ Rakuza Robatayaki was established in 2014 in Taichung. While there
        are many Japanese-style Izakayas in Taiwan, it is unlikely that you have
        experienced sitting in front of a bar filled with fresh vegetables and
        watching a master chef kneel in front of you while cooking your meal.
        This is because the technique of catching fresh seafood before cooking
        it on a large square stove inside, known locally as "robatayaki," has
        long been a tradition in Sendai City in Japan's Miyagi Prefecture but is
        not common in Taiwan. However, this cooking technique has finally made
        its way to Taichung.Robatayaki emphasizes the freshness and quality of
        ingredients, as well as the skills of the chef in preparing and
        presenting the food. It's also known for its casual and lively
        atmosphere, where customers can interact with the chef and enjoy the
        food in a communal setting. ðŸŒ¸
